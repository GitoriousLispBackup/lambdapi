LambdaPi

A Lisp-based operating system for the Raspberry Pi single board computer.

To build, you'll need an arm-none-eabi toolchain (gnu binutils and gcc).

In order to build, you'll need (at least once) to run 'make newlib-install'.
This will install a local copy of newlib, which we need for its implementation
of libm and some wrappers around libc functionality.  The install is local, in 
$LAMBDAPI/newlib/usr Building newlib takes a while.  Sorry about that.

Once you have newlib installed, building should be a simple case of running
"make" in the top level.

Debugging under qemu is possible, assuming you have a build of qemu-0.15
and gdb compiled for arm-none-eabi.  Use debug.sh from the top level and
you should be dropped into gdb already connected to qemu runing the image.
(Sorry, I like TUI in gdb, but you can change that in the supplied gdbinit)
